# WorldRESTAPI
This is a REST API for the World MySQL database, using Spring Boot and Spring Data Rest.

To run the application go to the root of the project and do

```
mvn clean install
```
and
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
This will start an application, most probably on port 8080 if it's not already busy. You can then 
access the api on http://localhost:8080/.
